# Avi's Graph Paper Notes

I like to do everything by hand first (when feasible) since it's relaxing for me. My decision to do the Cryptopals Challenges came out of a need to find something cute to serve as a distraction/coping mechanism for when I was travelling in Seattle for Hushcon/San Francisco/etc. So here are notes! I'll add more as need be.

First thing I did was write a base64 and an ASCII table. Forgot to write the binary part of the table but eh oops.

It turns out I've somehow never bothered to actually look up how base64 was done before. I felt incredibly dumb after because it was so simple but also so happy once I realised it was just the first six numbers in binary. So that happened. Wrote XOR just in case.

This was Challenge 2: Fixed XOR. I wasn't entirely sure on what an XOR sum was (more things I thought I knew and realised I didn't actually know oops) so this ensured I actually know it now. It's super cute! The side notes with the binary sideways was when I taught some very drunk folks at a bar nearby the con how to do binary.

Oh yeah just to get this out of the way I was very distracted by how adorable the sharks were at Hushcon and poorly doodled them during their talk! #cabletap

I haven't really moved on past this mostly because I ended up having no real spare time to myself to hide in a corner since everyone was so darling to hang out with. But this is some of the work I got done on Challenge 3: Single-byte XOR cipher.
