# Avi in Cryptopals Challenge Wonderland

Oh golly hi! These are my solutions and work on the [Cryptopals Crypto Challenges](https://cryptopals.com/) in C, Go (Golang), JavaScript, Python, Ruby. Eventually I'll settle on finishing it in one language then go back. Here's an example of my current set up:

```
├── c                   # Solutions in C
├── go                  # Solutions in Go
│   ├──1.go             # Solution #1 file in Go
│   ├──2.go             # Solution #2 file in Go
│   ├── ...             # Solution #{i} file in Go
│   ├── README.md       # List of which challenges are completed, notes, etc.

## Challenges

I've hyperlinked sets 1-2 with their challenges, sets 3-8 I'll repeat the same for once I get there. Language(s) completed in will be written in bold inside brackets next to them.
